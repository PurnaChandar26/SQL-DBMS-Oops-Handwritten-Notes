The DBMS section focuses on Database Management Systems. A DBMS is the software that handles database creation, maintenance, and management. The notes in this section cover topics like:

- Database Design and ER Diagrams

- Database Architecture

- Query Optimization

- ACID Properties

- Data Security and Authentication

- NoSQL Databases

## OOPs Interview Questions

The OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) section delves into core concepts of object-oriented programming, which is widely used in software development. These notes cover topics such as:

- Classes and Objects

- Inheritance and Polymorphism

- Encapsulation and Abstraction

- Object-Oriented Design Principles (SOLID)

- Design Patterns

- Exception Handling
